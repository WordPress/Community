        ## Next steps
         - Please assign the issue to the team member and make sure to mark the issue ```To Do```
         - Assignee (Team Member) will mark the issue as ```In Progress``` and perform the vetting taks on the tracker and HS as indicated on the handbook
         - Once the vetting is completed marke the issue as ```In Review```
        
        ## Public vs Private
          - Use comments for questions about the process and changes or to indicate delays, holding situation.
          - Avoid discussing the community or the organiser in comments on Github. Even if there are doubts about some applications.
          - We do not post vetting notes publicly and ensure such notes are strictly in the tracker or HelpScout.
